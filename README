Running Instructions:
	1. Download and unzip the battledot file
	2. In the terminal navigate to the ~/battledot director and type make
	3. Execute the compiled program via ./battlenetdot <positive integer value >= 2>
	4. Once running is completed, type command make clean to clear object and executable files

Makefile targets:
	1. make: Builds the executable battledotnet file. Included are the battledotnet.h, player.h, grid.h, and main.cpp
	2. make clean: Removes all object and executable files

Notes:
	\This program is designed for usage on Linux. Implementation 
	\was done via creating a thread for each player in the game.
	\Ensure g++ is installed on your Linux device.
	\This program contained the following classes:

		-Grid class: the battledot grid object. Creates a 10x10 in which dots are used to
		represent open space. This class uses truly random number generator method to place a ship
		on the grid. 

		-Player class: associates a board, ID and target to each player object. The associated attributes
		outline the actions the player class can take.

		-BattleDot class: brings together all the players in the game. Executes all the actions of the players
		once per round. It ensures every player gets a turn in once per round before the next round of actions can 
		begin. In this game, players attack unidirectionally. They are linked in a circle, and can only attack 
		the next person in the same direction of the circle once they've eliminated their current opponent. Once a player 			has eliminated all the others, they are declared the winner.

			-to slow down the out stream, increase the integer value in this_thread::sleep_for on line 63. This value 				is in milliseconds.

	\This program does not require any further input once started. Once executed, the program will output the moves of every
	player to console, output the players who are eliminated, and at the end it will signal the winner all by their ID
